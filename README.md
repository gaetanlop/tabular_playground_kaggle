## Complete roadmap on how I worked on this competition

* 11/02: Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna
* 12/02: Decision Tree/ XGBoost hyperparameter tuning
* 13/02: Practical implementation of XGBoost and Optuna
* 15/02: Shap Values Theory + practical Implementation
* Tried some Feature Engineering ideas with no success + 10 folds did not improve the model

Tomorrow: 1h: lgbm theory + 1h: lgbm implementation
